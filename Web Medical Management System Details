manage patient records, appointment schedules, and medical histories.
• Utilized Java technologies such as Servlets, JSP, and JDBC to implement the
application’s backend logic and connect to a MySQL database.
• Implemented a responsive and user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript, with Bootstrap and jQuery libraries.
• Contributed to the design and implementation of the database schema, including
entity-relationship diagrams and normalization.
